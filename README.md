Just a couple notes to the developers looking at the code 
- Couldn't find the data in the API for "Mieten" and "Kaufen" (I believe this means to rent or buy) 
- Not quite sure if I put the correct price 
- If I had more time I would of used the bootstrap grid system and put the styles in a stylesheet 
- To start the app, clone/download then npm start (localhost:8080)
