Just a couple notes to the developers looking at the code 
- Couldn't find the data in the API for "Mieten" and "Kaufen" (I believe this means to rent or buy) 
- Not sure how the price should be formatted
- If given more time I would probably use the bootstrap grid system and properly place the styles in a stylesheet
